<div class="textheader">FreeGLUT 3.0</div>
<p>
Major work, its status and planned milestone. <a
href="help.php">Help</a> on any of these plans is very welcome!</p>
<table>
<tr>
<th>Feature</th><th>Status</th><th>Milestone</th></tr>
<tr><td>Android port</td><td>Basic but complete functionality by Sylvain
Beucler, but there are <a href=docs/android.php#roadmap>todo
points</a></td><td>Basic functionality as is now done: 3.0. Future
enhancements: 3.0 or later.</td></tr>

<tr><td>GL2+ and GLES 1/2 clean API for geometry</td><td>Done for all (geometry like
cube, cone, etc, as well as the teapot and other parts of the
teaset)</td><td>3.0</td></tr>

<tr><td>GL2+ and GLES 1/2 clean API for fonts and menus</td><td>Not sure what can be done
here really. Menus will continue to work fine with OpenGL 3+ exclusive
applications as long as the platform provides legacy contexts, as menus
have their own rendering context. For text rendering, its probably best if the
user looks at freetype and the like and avoids the use of FreeGLUT's
text API</td><td>Probably impossible to do anything here</td></tr>

<tr><td>At runtime loading of OpenGL, OpenGL ES1 or OpenGL ES2 libraries,
like SDL.</td><td>Currently CMake variables define at compile time which
of these three the library will be compiled against. No work has been
done on moving this to an at-runtime API.</td><td>Having this in 3.0
would be nice, but not essential.</td></tr>

<tr><td>Code reorganized such that platform-specific and display
server-specific code are decoupled</td><td>Done, thanks John Fay! This
already lead to a port to Android and support for GLES 1/2 on X11
(thanks Sylvain for both!), and paves the way for implementing native
OSX and Wayland support</td><td>3.0</td></tr>

<tr><td>Position callback</td><td>Done: we now have a position callback
to notify the client when the position of the window
changed.</td><td>3.0</td></tr>
<tr><td>

<tr><td>Carbon/Cocoa port</td><td>Not started. As Carbon is legacy, one
might want to port to Cocoa first or even forget about Carbon all
together.</td><td>Undecided</td></tr>

<tr><td>Wayland port</td><td>Not started.</td><td>Undecided</td></tr>

<tr><td>Complete glutInitDisplayString support</td><td>FreeGLUT now only
partially supports glutInitDisplayString, any spec (comparator and
value) after each token are ignored. This is a significant way in which
FreeGLUT is not compatible with GLUT. Could be a nice project for
someone who want to become familiar with the intricacies of requesting
specific display formats on at least one of the various window servers
(Windows and X11 at the moment).</td><td>Undecided</td></tr>
